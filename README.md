## Elysium Planitia

Using NASA's Insight API and React, I created a Martian Weather App.


## How To Use

**Due to a (welcome) security change in Heroku's CORS-Anywhere Demo Server, you'll first need to request permission to access the server. This can be done [here](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo).**

In order to use this app, you must first generate your own personal Access Token. This can be done free from - https://api.nasa.gov/
With an Access Token in hand navigate to src/Insight/Insight.js and paste this in the accessToken variable. The app is now ready to use.

Simply run ```npm start``` to open the React development server and view the project in your browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
