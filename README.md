## Elysium Planitia

Using NASA's Insight API and React, I created a Martian Weather App.

In order to use this app, you must first generate your own personal Access Token. This can be done free from - https://api.nasa.gov/
With an Access Token in hand navigate to src/Insight/Insight.js and paste this in the accessToken variable. The app is now ready to use.
